So you know what's coming next.... 

After we get best-sellers / missing items done, "Brand Representation" will come next.

In this, we measure the quantity/quality of a brand's representation on a site and across sites.

For example, we will want to know:

- How many items does Amazon.com (Walmart.com, Bestbuy.com, etc.) have for the brand "Charmin" or "Sony"
- What is the distribution of ratings for these items on a given site 
- How many ratings are there for a particular brand on a given site
- What is the mean / median rating and mean / median number of ratings
- Other stats specific to a given brand (vs. a given category like Televisions)

So I will want to supply a list of brand keywords and then you take the crawl data for those keywords, analyze the data, and summarize the results.
