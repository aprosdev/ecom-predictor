# New scraper tickets should be assigned as follows:

* Walmart/Amazon scraper issues - CH: Matt (CH); SC: Andrii or Arseniy

* Complex issues for existing scrapers (JCP total failure, etc.) - Arseniy / Andrii

* Overnight PST scraper issues - Victor

* New scrapers should be spread across Luis, Ivan and Jakub 
   ** If Andrii or Arseniy have capacity, you can assign them new scrapers, but only P8 or lower. Don't assign them P9 new scrapers because they need to be available for walmart/amazon/existing issues.
   ** Assign the same developer to work on all 3 tickets (SC, Shelf, CH)
* Sitemaps - Ivan

# Architecture/core issues should be assigned as follows:

* scrapy_daemon, sckiller, tech debt, logging, alerting - Arnold with help from Nicolas and Andrii

* sc-cache - Luis, review by Arnold

* New cache - Jim plus Nicolas, Victor or Luis

# APIs

* API/data conversion - AndreiK

* RetailLink - Victor

* Regression server - Victor
