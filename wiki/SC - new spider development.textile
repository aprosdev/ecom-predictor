h2. Here is the list of must-have fields for new SC spiders:

* title
* url (this is usually filled with base class)
* brand (if there are no brand field on page, use "guess_brand_from_first_words" method from "product_ranking.guess_brand")
* price (if there are several values, scraper should scrape lowest)
* is_out_of_stock
* no_longer_available
* description (Description with html tags)
* image_url
* total_matches
* department (bottom-level one, basically last element of categories list)
* ranking (usually filled with base class)
* reseller_id (generally extracted from product url)

New scrapers should be able to handle both searchterms and single-product urls.

If you see that variant/reviews/questions&answers fields can be implemented fast, do it. Otherwise they can be implemented later if needed. Don't forget to write message in ticket it those fields were implemented. 

Regarding reviews field: if website use bazaarvoice API, we have script to parse JSON response at:
